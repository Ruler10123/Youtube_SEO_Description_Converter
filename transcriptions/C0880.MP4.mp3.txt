[1.54-4.38]  Good morning everyone, this is a day in the life of Sean Hergo.
[5.00-7.26]  Now, let's see what time it is.
[7.44-9.08]  It seems to be approximately 3am.
[10.50-11.80]  Maybe not, it's light out.
[12.22-16.18]  But what are we saying, we've become Australian, but that's how Sean wakes up sometimes, on
[16.18-18.00]  the wrong side of the bed, or the right, who knows.
[18.32-19.20]  Crikey, crikey.
[19.52-23.44]  Sometimes it's Australian, sometimes it's British, and sometimes it's just plain old
[23.44-23.86]  action.
[24.34-25.26]  I don't fucking know.
[25.74-26.36]  But yeah.
   But [25.74-25.88]
   yeah. [25.88-26.36]
