[0.00-3.18]  What's the difference between teaching and coaching?
[3.66-4.44]  Hey there, it's Chris Westfall,
[4.50-6.00]  and I wanted to record this short video
[6.00-9.60]  to introduce you to someone who I worked with,
[9.64-12.28]  a very talented student by the name of Chase Lanow.
[12.82-15.64]  And when you're teaching someone, right,
[15.64-18.68]  as a teacher or professor, you have the agenda,
[18.78-20.54]  the curriculum, and the objectives,
[20.70-22.24]  the rubric for the course, that sort of thing.
[22.64-23.84]  And you say things like,
[23.86-25.54]  we're gonna start at chapter one.
[26.76-27.54]  Coaching's different.
[28.32-30.88]  Coaching meets you where you are,
[31.04-34.44]  and the agenda or the syllabus
[34.44-36.82]  is co-created in the coaching conversation.
[36.94-37.90]  It's a little bit different.
[38.20-41.42]  You understand that a coach has to meet you where you are.
[41.60-43.44]  So let's take a look, first of all,
[43.46-46.82]  at where Chase was when he presented to the Aggie 100
[46.82-50.98]  after winning Aggie Pitch with his innovative idea here,
[50.98-53.02]  because Chase was going to compete
[53.02-56.78]  in the SEC Pitch Competition at the University of Tennessee.
[57.30-59.52]  So he was competing against all the other schools
[59.52-61.40]  in the SEC Conference,
[62.18-66.28]  and he wanted to share his message with greater impact.
[66.62-71.70]  So we worked on it, and well, anyway, I've said enough.
[72.28-73.84]  Let Chase tell you the rest of the story.
[74.66-76.52]  All right, this pitch is different from where you used to,
[76.98-78.56]  because you can't just sit here and watch it.
[78.58-80.64]  In fact, let me cut this off.
[81.12-82.20]  You need to feel it.
[82.36-84.60]  So if willing and able, would you please stand up with me?
[87.76-88.16]  Awesome.
[88.48-90.30]  All right, let's get a slight bend in the knees
[90.30-92.38]  and bring your chest forward until your chin
[92.38-93.88]  is a couple inches in front of your toes.
[94.58-95.80]  Perfect, now hold this position.
[96.64-97.70]  Not very comfortable, right?
[98.14-100.24]  I'm 21 years old and I don't even like doing this.
[100.48-101.94]  Reach around a few of your lower back muscles.
[102.10-103.62]  Feel how tight and contracted they are.
[103.84-105.34]  They're fired up right now, working hard
[105.34-106.64]  to keep up her body at this angle.
[107.12-110.00]  Imagine holding this for five, six, even seven hours.
[110.00-111.56]  How long would it be till you start shaking?
[112.18-113.88]  What would happen to your cognitive ability
[113.88-114.82]  as time went on?
[114.82-117.18]  This is the challenge that surgeons face every day.
[117.32-118.34]  Thank you, you can sit down.
[119.20-120.20]  Seven hours, people.
[120.70-122.12]  And it's not just a one-time thing.
[122.46-124.30]  You have a seven-hour procedure every Monday,
[124.50-126.70]  Wednesday, Friday, every single week.
[127.28-129.24]  That's what cardiac surgeon Dr. Ruhl here does.
[129.54-131.50]  My dad, he's a surgeon, he's in the middle, trust me.
[131.54-133.52]  He loves telling me about his back pain.
[133.90-135.40]  And Dr. Mason here has the same issue.
[135.50-137.22]  It turns out that 70% of surgeons
[137.22-138.88]  have recurrent lower back pain.
[139.78-142.00]  This physically demanding task affects work performance,
[142.24-144.54]  productivity, and ultimately career longevity
[144.54-145.06]  for surgeons.
[145.66-147.34]  And it's also a leading cause to a prominent issue
[147.34-149.20]  right now called surgeon burnout.
[149.30-151.56]  This burnout is a state of complete exhaustion
[151.56-153.74]  that's been experienced by 80% of surgeons
[153.74-156.86]  and is caused by this overload of intense focus and strain.
[157.16-158.78]  And it's not just a personal issue for them
[158.78-161.64]  because studies have shown that surgeons experiencing burnout
[161.64-164.30]  were twice as likely to make a major medical error
[164.30-166.08]  compared to their non-burnout peers.
[166.60-168.18]  Hey, nobody wants their surgeon to be suffering,
[168.72-170.74]  especially when you're that patient that's on the table.
[170.98-173.10]  But the good news is that it doesn't have to be like this.
[173.10-174.20]  My name is Chase Lanow.
[174.36-176.32]  I'm a junior engineering major from Texas A&M
[176.32-178.86]  and my patent pending product is called surgeon support.
[179.56-180.88]  Surgeon support is an adjustable pad
[180.88-182.44]  that attaches onto the operating table.
[182.74-184.04]  It allows the surgeon to lean on it,
[184.06-186.28]  to take the load off their back and stabilize their hands.
[186.80-189.38]  It provides the support and stability that the surgeon needs
[189.38-191.50]  in order to focus on the patient care
[191.50-192.60]  without the physical burden.
[192.98-194.90]  This is backed by electromyography studies.
[195.06-196.76]  I've found that muscle activity in the back
[196.76-199.04]  is significantly reduced when you're able to lean forward
[199.04-199.96]  and rest on something.
[200.66-202.72]  It's versatile and it can even act as an armrest
[202.72-203.60]  when the surgeon's seated.
[203.80-206.80]  I embedded this with input from surgeons of different fields
[206.80-208.66]  ensuring that every surgeon can find
[208.66-210.08]  their ideal ergonomic position
[210.08-211.78]  regardless of the surgery type.
[212.74-214.56]  It attaches to the standard operating table
[214.56-216.36]  by clamping onto a universal rail.
[216.84-219.02]  There's over 150,000 of these tables in the world
[219.02-220.68]  and 26,000 sold per year.
[221.64-223.32]  It fits seamlessly into the operating room.
[223.42-225.12]  It has a quick and easy setup and take down.
[225.28-227.70]  Its minimal presence ensures that there's plenty of room
[227.70-229.82]  for the patient and the operating room workers.
[230.20-232.36]  It can be cleaned and draped to maintain a sterile area
[232.36-234.38]  and it does not limit the surgeon's needed range
[234.38-234.90]  of mobility.
[235.42-236.86]  It's also a class one medical device
[236.86-239.10]  so there's no lengthy FDA approval.
[239.18-240.84]  It's only subject to standard controls.
[242.44-243.18]  Meet my mentors.
[243.38-244.26]  We got Mr. Roland Block.
[244.42-246.42]  He's an engineer at the biggest operating table company
[246.42-246.98]  in the nation.
[247.28-248.54]  He actually helped design the tables
[248.54-249.96]  that Surgeon Support clamps onto.
[250.40-251.82]  We got Dr. Jason Harris,
[252.18-253.64]  deemed the second most prolific inventor
[253.64-254.96]  in Johnson & Johnson history.
[254.96-257.62]  And we got Dr. Michael Moreno, the director of innovation
[257.62-259.68]  at A&M's Engineering Medicine School.
[260.04-262.02]  These men have helped me develop a solid game plan
[262.02-263.84]  and Surgeon Support will mostly be sold
[263.84-265.30]  to surgery centers and hospitals.
[265.82-269.04]  There's 12,000 of these facilities in the US alone
[269.04-271.92]  and 60,000 operating rooms within these facilities.
[273.20-276.76]  It can be made in quantity for $700 per unit
[276.76-278.14]  and sold at $4,500.
[278.66-280.36]  There's also a repeat revenue stream
[280.36-283.16]  of single use disposable units called surgical drapes,
[283.18-285.46]  giving it a razor and razor blade sales model.
[286.46-289.30]  The ultimate goal is to license the right to manufacture
[289.30-292.08]  and sell Surgeon Support to an operating table company.
[292.62-294.08]  These companies have many reasons
[294.08-295.66]  to reach a licensing agreement.
[296.64-299.52]  For one, when the operating table companies negotiate
[299.52-301.40]  their sales at their tables with hospitals
[301.40-303.90]  and surgery centers, they aim for bundled sales contracts
[303.90-305.50]  that include the tables themselves
[305.50-308.30]  and a suite of table accessories to go along with the tables.
[308.78-310.72]  The capabilities of the products within this bundle
[310.72-312.56]  differentiate one company from the other.
[312.94-314.70]  And with the rising awareness of Surgeon Care
[314.70-317.02]  and efforts to reduce surgeon burnout,
[317.02-319.86]  implementing Surgeon Support can be the deciding factor
[319.86-321.74]  in securing these multimillion dollar contracts.
[322.34-325.14]  And two, the market for selling Surgeon Support
[325.14-327.20]  isn't just limited to selling it with the new tables.
[327.70-329.46]  Since it attaches onto that standard rail
[329.46-332.12]  that's universal among all operating tables,
[332.76-335.70]  Surgeon Support can be sold to every surgery center
[335.70-338.82]  and hospital looking to extend their surgeon's careers.
[339.26-341.14]  So if you felt the impact of this
[341.14-344.42]  and you wanna contribute to prolonging patient care
[344.42-347.80]  and enhancing it, an investment of $250,000
[348.60-350.30]  would be allocated to product refinement,
[350.70-354.08]  FDA strategizing, and intellectual property fees.
[354.72-356.38]  When your life is in the hands of a surgeon,
[356.98-358.66]  why wouldn't you want that surgeon to have support?
[359.08-359.84]  Thank you.
[363.42-365.84]  When it comes to the coaching conversation,
[365.92-368.38]  coaching focuses on your success.
[368.68-370.18]  Coaching meets you where you are.
[370.58-373.26]  And when it's time to change the conversation,
[373.46-375.04]  you can change your results.
[375.94-378.54]  And the power in coaching, I know as a coach
[378.54-381.34]  and having been coached in many aspects of my life,
[381.34-384.18]  the power inside the coaching conversation is
[384.18-385.72]  you don't have to go it alone.
[385.88-387.80]  You've got somebody that's riding shotgun
[387.80-389.82]  that can offer a different perspective.
[390.46-392.14]  When you have someone in your corner
[392.70-396.56]  who is as focused on your goals as you are,
[397.76-399.84]  it's a powerful, powerful start
[400.40-401.80]  to a new kind of conversation.
[402.96-404.30]  Thanks again for watching this video.
[404.38-406.50]  My name's Chris Westphal, and I'll talk to you again soon.
   My [404.38-404.48]
   name's [404.48-404.68]
   Chris [404.68-404.90]
   Westphal, [404.90-405.30]
   and [405.54-405.62]
   I'll [405.62-405.76]
   talk [405.76-405.90]
   to [405.90-406.00]
   you [406.00-406.08]
   again [406.08-406.24]
   soon. [406.24-406.50]
