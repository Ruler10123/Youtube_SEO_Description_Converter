So far I have converted video to audio to a simple transcript
- I might want a better transcript that has timestamps, but we'll see (ok lol I did it)

Here's probably how it's gonna go:
- video -> audio -> transcript (w/ timestamps) -> throw it into an LLM (LOL) ->
-> return a structured JSON or just nice txt file for ease of reading and copying for me ->
-> implement JSON with Youtube Data API to automate the video creation pipeline in like one button lol
(like it probably will create a draft with all of the necessary info, and SEO keywords)

Things to Implement:
- Switch from whisper to faster_whisper because I guess it's just better (running on PyTorch with high VRAM
usage and slow CPU support vs just like faster and better version of it)
- JSON output from LLM or something
- Probably set this up on my PC as a microservice I can just call so I use its computing resources instead of my laptop with pretty bad specs lol
    - Would this be like a Docker container?
    - How would I send/have the scripts see my video files unless they're already in there?
    - Proably something with Tailscale because I know they have file sharing over the network (or something)
- Hashing: sha256 to check for duplicates (and skip over them so there's no extra computing for optimization)
- Youtube Data API bc that's a thing ig, let's see if we can automate the Youtube video creation pipeline :>>>
