[1.42s -> 26.77s]  Good morning everyone, this is day in life for Sean Howgo. Now, let's see what time it is. It seems to be approximately 3am. Maybe not, it's light out. But what are we saying? We've became Australian, but that's how Sean wakes up sometimes, on the wrong side of the bed, or the right, who knows. Crikey, crikey. Sometimes it's Australian, sometimes it's British, and sometimes I'm just plain old Texan. I don't fucking know. But yeah.
